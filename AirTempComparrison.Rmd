In this script, we compare the two air temperature datasets that were used in the analysis
We start by reading in the hourly air temperature from the Hall data. This is the air tempeature modeled for every stream reach in the region from 1981 - 2014

```{r}



load(file = 'L:/Flow ecology and climate change_ES/Jenny/AirTemp/AirTemperature_Baseline/temperature_K.RData')
temperature_C<- temperature_K %>% 
  mutate(temp_C = temp_K-273.15) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-temp_K)


```


Next we need to extract the air temperature at each COMID from the Livneh data and calculate the mid range.



Then we will join the temperatures together based on date and COMID and get the correlation between Halls and Livnehs

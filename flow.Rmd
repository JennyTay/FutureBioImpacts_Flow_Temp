1. baseline flow metrics: 2010 (moderate), 1993 (wet), 2014 (dry)
2. future GCM averaged flow metrics: 2100 (moderate), 2095 (wet), and 2090 (dry) 
3. subtract the baseline year comids from the future year comids for each water year type and plot the violin plots of change for the 3 years types. this will replace table 8 and figure 6
4. table 9 - want to have the categores be high and low elevation instead of watershed. have it by water year type, and then baseline future. have an averaged value across all comids , and include the standard error reported
